# Users with Bank Accounts
* Coding Dojo Assignment: Object Oriented Programming in Python

# Objectives:
* Practice writing classes with class associations.

* Update your existing User class to have an association with the BankAccount class. (For reference, User class, before association, and BankAccount class are found in the repositories named User and Bank Account repectively.)

* Use modularization in order to create modules of the User class
and the BankAccount class and import each module as needed.

* Update User class, so that each instantiated user has multiple accounts upon instantiation.

# Tasks:
* Update the User class __init__ method.

* Update the User class make_deposit method.

* Update the User class make_withdrawal method.

* Update the User class display_user_balance method.

* SENSEI BONUS: Allow a user to have multiple accounts; update methods so the user has to specify which account they are withdrawing or depositing to.
